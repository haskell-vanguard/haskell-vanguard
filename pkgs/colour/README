I hope for this library to become the standard colour library for Haskell.
Most software does not properly blend colours because they fail to
gamma-correct the colours before blending.  Hopefully by using this library,
Haskell programs dealing with colour blending will avoid this problem.

There are some optimizing RULES pragmas that could be added to improve
preformance.  If you are having performace issues with colour, please
let me know, and we will test some of these pragmas.

Bug reports and any patches are also welcome.  Be warned, I haven't
extensively tested this library yet.
