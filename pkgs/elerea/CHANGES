2.9.0 - 160618
* removed clocked variant, as it proved to be impractical
* renamed external to unsafeExternal
* introduced safe (managed) external signals
* renamed until to till to avoid name clash with the prelude

2.8.0 - 140122
* added MonadIO and MonadBase instances for SignalGen (Mitsutoshi Aoe)

2.7.0.2 - 120401
* added some inlining annotations (courtesy of Takano Akio)

2.7.0.1 - 120131
* made externalMulti thread-safe (courtesy of Takano Akio)

2.7.0 - 111223
* fixed an issue with nested signal creations not updating properly
  (courtesy of Takano Akio)
* added reference implementation for the simple variant

2.6.0 - 111211
* added snapshot to all variants, which allows sampling signals within
  signal generators

2.5.0 - 111122
* added SignalGen liftIO equivalent to assist library writers
* simplified the signatures of effectful* combinators
* updated Param to use the more modern codebase (like Simple and
  Clocked); this was necessary to support effectful signals
* temporarily removed the static optimisation from Param
* removed dependency on mersenne-random
* removed legacy branch

2.4.0 - 111111
* added effectful signals to assist library writers

2.3.0 - 110627
* reimplemented clocked variant in a correct and more efficient way

2.2.0 - 110402
* added n-ary transfer functions
* temporarily removed transfer from the clocked variant
* revised documentation

2.1.0 - 100805
* reimplemented the parametric variant in a way that doesn't require
  signals to carry the type of the parameter any more
* added the ability to extract the global input in the parametric
  variant, and also to override it (input and embed, resp.)
* added until to be able to define switchers that can truly drop
  references to old signals
* added debug printing capability to the simple and clocked variants
* made a note about possibly deprecating the delayed variant

2.0.0 - 100718
* moved experimental branch to the top (version 1 went into legacy
  status)
* added the clocked variant

1.2.3 - 100131
* added externalMulti to handle events that can fire several times
  within a superstep
* added a cache to the noise signal for safety reasons, so it lives in
  SignalGen now

1.2.2 - 100115
* added noise signals and the getRandom primitive (using mersenne-random)

1.2.1 - 091204
* modified the &&@ and ||@ operators to short-circuit

1.2.0 - 091202
* added the delayed variant to the experimental branch
* renamed storeJust to (-->) in the experimental branch

1.1.0 - 091126
* added experimental branch with a cleaner semantics

1.0.0 - 090726
* completely renewed interface by introducing the SignalMonad

0.6.0 - 090507
* renamed Void to StartToken
* replaced restarter with the simpler and more versatile startTokens

0.5.0 - 090502
* changed names of internal constructors to match primitives better
* added restarter and (==>)
* removed the unused type synonym Time

0.4.0 - 090501
* added keepAlive
* made delay a primitive
* completely separated sampling and aging

0.3.0 - 090419
* documentation bug fixed: the latcher is not delayed
* added dot (Graphviz) converter

0.2.0 - 090412
* removed primitives time and stateless
* removed default delay on stateful combinators and added experimental
  cycle detection
* added some non-primitive combinators: delay, edge, comparisons,
  logic relations
* added signal instances for various numeric classes

0.1.0 - 090410
* first public version
